# AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 


## 19.FEV.2022 True Crime Trailer 

Being passionate about "True Crime" series (no, not podcasts, I still haven't got the hang to listen to podcasts), I never skip the main titles. 

The idea to produce a main title, for a True Crime series that hasn't been developed yet, was something that I started to grow on me and I finally got around to do it. 

Here's the end result

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/1kgzl6" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>
